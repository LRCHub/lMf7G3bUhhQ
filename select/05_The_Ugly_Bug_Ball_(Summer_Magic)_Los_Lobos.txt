Once a lonely caterpillar sat and cried
To a sympathetic beetle by his side
I've got nobody to hug
I'm such an ugly bug

Then a spider and a dragonfly replied
If you're serious and want to win a bride
Come along with us to the glorious
Annual ugly bug ball

Come on let's crawl, crawl, crawl
To the ugly bug ball
A happy time we'll have
One and all at the ugly bug ball

While the crickets click their cricky melodies
And the ants were fancy dancing with the fleas

Then up from under the ground
Worms came squirming around
And they danced until their legs were nearly lame
Every little crawling creature you could name
Everyone was glad what a time they had
They were so happy they came

Come on let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Ugly bug ball
And a happy time we'll have
One and all, ugly bug ball

Then our caterpillar saw a pretty queen
She was beautiful, yellow black and green
He said, "Would you care to dance"
Their dancing lead to romance

Then she sat upon his caterpillar knee
And he gave his caterpillar queen a squeeze
Soon they'll honeymoon, build a big cocoon
Thanks to the ugly bug ball

Come on let's crawl, crawl, crawl
To the ugly bug ball
And a happy time we'll have
One and all, the ugly bug ball

Come on let's crawl, crawl, crawl
To the ugly bug ball
And a happy time we'll have
One and all at the ugly bug ball
