Three creaky wooden stairs
Those squeaky rocking chairs
The well worn welcome mat
The lattice vines, the happy times
All I wanna do when the day is through
Is linger here on the front porch with you
From the wicker swing, while the night birds sing
We'll watch the fireflies sparkin, do some sparkin to
How the hours fly, as the moon drifts by
How sweet the air as we stare at the sun
Oh how I'd love to linger here like this,
Hold your hand and steal a kiss or two on the front porch with you
All I wanna do, when the day is through
Is linger here on the front porch with you
On the worker swing, as the night birds sing
We'll watch the fireflies sparking do some sparking too
How the hours fly, as the moon drifts by
How sweet the air, as we stare at the sun
Oh how I love to linger here like this
Hold your hand and steal a kiss or two
On the front porch with you
